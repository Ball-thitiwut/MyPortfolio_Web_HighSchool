                <h2>I'm THITIWUT THITNUEA</h2>
                <p> My name is Ball. I'm from Thailand. I live in Chiang Mai Chiang Mai is in the north of Thailand. I am 18 years old. My family lives in a small village. I come from a relatively small family. 
                    There are 5 people in my family.My mother's name is Bum. My father's name is Sem. I have one grandfather. His name is Duang and I have a grandmother, her name is Chan.

                    I'm at Dara Academy. I'm in grade 12 I like math But I don't like biology. because it is a subject that has a lot of specialized vocabulary my mother is a teacher She teaches the science and My father has his own business.

                    When I was in 11th grade, I participated in a Gifted School program hosted by CAMT as a course on game making. When I was in school I learned character design and coding.
                    I love coding, I find it very exciting and educational. But I don't like character design because it has to use ideas and imaginations which I'm not good at. So I started to study programming and wanted to study in a faculty that mainly studied programming. 
                    I hope that in the future I will be able to apply what I have learned to my family business.
